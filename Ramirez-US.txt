1. As a user, I want to be able to switch and upgrade my weapons midway through a battle, so that I can defeat the higher level monsters coming through the map.

2. As a user, I want a game mode with a user specified time limit, so that I can play when I have only a specific amount of time free.

3. As a user, I would like to have multiplayer functionality, so that I can get to know real people through the game.
