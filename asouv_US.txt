User Stories

As a student who has a long commute, I want to an engaging game to occupy me for at least 30 minutes but not more than 45 minutes, so that the time can seem to pass by faster.

As a user, I want to be able to pause mid-game, so that I can play during my free time. 

As a user, I want to be able to customize the overall style to my favorite color, so the game can feel more personal.
